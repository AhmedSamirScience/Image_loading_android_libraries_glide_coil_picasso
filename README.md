## Coil:

These days, The Coil is gaining more and more popularity. Why is it growing more common? due to the fact that Kotlin was used in its creation. Coil handles Kotlin Coroutines and OkHttp and is fast, lightweight, and modern. Coil is the first open source image loading library written in Kotlin for android, so keep that in mind.
