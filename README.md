# Image loading library for Android (Glide - Coil - Picasso)

***
### Description about libraries:

## 1- Glide
A quick and effective open-source media management and image loading framework for Android, Glide combines resource pooling, memory and disc caching, and media decoding into a user-friendly interface. Additionally, it allows for the retrieval, decoding, and display of video stills, pictures, and animated GIFs.

## 2- Coil
These days, The Coil is gaining more and more popularity. Why is it growing more common? due to the fact that Kotlin was used in its creation. Coil handles Kotlin Coroutines and OkHttp and is fast, lightweight, and modern. Coil is the first open source image loading library written in Kotlin for android, so keep that in mind.

## 3- Picasso
a strong Android image downloader and cache library tool. One of the first libraries in this field to be founded. On the one hand, this raises the risk in my opinion, that new technologies won't be supported because of the outdated source.

### Measure the performance of these libraries:

The point is to measure and give you a rough idea of Coils Glide and Picasso performance and when to use each. So, we'll compare how quickly files are downloaded from the network and loaded from the cache.
